# Windows RT Gui Test

A joke simulator of Windows RT. I'm still mad about no Win32 support, M$.

## NOTICE

These are unmodified builds of Windows RT Gui Test. They contain swear words.

Please DO NOT USE these unless you are making a 17+ game with Strong Language enabled, or you may get a ban or termination on Roblox, or you're removing swear words. (They're located in the Command Prompt and the big popup thing)

# You have been warned.
