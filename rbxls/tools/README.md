## Tools

This folder contains the tool I made for downloading all of the place versions at once. It's only been tested on arm64 macOS, but could probably run on x86-64/x86 macOS (maybe even ppc?) and Linux.

Requires cURL to be installed on your computer.

If the script won't run, make sure you run ```chmod +x``` on it first.
